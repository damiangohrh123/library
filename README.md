# library
Library project

UPDATE:
1. Completed the project.
2. Had to watch a youtube tutorial.
3. Used constructos and object prototypes for the removal and toggling of book properties.
4. Did not focus on CSS styling. Will continue to follow up next time.
5. Overall quite an easy project. Learnt more about prototypes and constructors. 
6. However, need to brush up on array functions. Seem to forget most of them. (E.g. splt, push)

UPDATE:
1. Refactored code to use classes. 
2. Code seems much neater now.
